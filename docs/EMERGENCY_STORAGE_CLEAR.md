# Emergency Storage Clear

If you're experiencing a `QuotaExceededError` with localStorage, you can immediately resolve it by running one of these commands in your browser's developer console:

## Quick Fix (Recommended)

Open your browser's developer console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Clear only the history storage
localStorage.removeItem('fumi-generation-history');
location.reload();
```

## Nuclear Option (If the above doesn't work)

```javascript
// Clear ALL localStorage data for this domain
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

## What This Does

- **Quick Fix**: Removes only the history data that's causing the quota issue
- **Nuclear Option**: Clears all localStorage data for the current domain (this will also clear any other app data stored in localStorage)

## Prevention

The app has been updated with:
- Automatic data optimization to reduce storage size
- Progressive fallback when storage is full
- Automatic cleanup of old history items
- Better error handling for quota exceeded errors

## Storage Manager Component

You can also use the StorageManager component in the app to monitor and manage your storage usage. This component provides:
- Real-time storage usage information
- Options to clear old items, all history, or all storage
- Emergency clear functionality

The error should not occur again with the new implementation, but if it does, the app will automatically recover by reducing the history size.
