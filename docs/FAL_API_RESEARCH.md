# Fal.ai Model Discovery Research

## Actual Endpoints Confirmed:
- `https://queue.fal.run` - Queue-based requests (main interface)
- `https://fal.run` - Direct synchronous requests

## Model List API Status:
- **No bulk model list API found** - Fal.ai doesn't appear to have a public endpoint to fetch all available models
- Model information needs to be discovered through:
  - Individual model documentation
  - API responses when models are used
  - Community resources and documentation

## Current Approach:
The implementation maintains your **6 static models** as the reliable foundation, with the discovery service as a framework for future API updates when they become available.

## Benefits of This Approach:
- ✅ **Never breaks** - Always falls back to your working static models
- ✅ **Framework ready** - Easy to connect a real model list API when Fal.ai adds one
- ✅ **Dynamic discovery** - Can be extended to discover models as they're used
- ✅ **Robust caching** - Performance optimizations ready to go

## Recommendation:
Keep the current implementation - it works perfectly with your static models and is prepared for future API extensions. When Fal.ai adds a model list endpoint, you just need to update the endpoint URLs in the discovery service.
